# posh-maven
A PowerShell helper module for mvn.
---

posh-maven adds autocomplete features and several helper functions 
for your day2day usage of maven to your PowerShell environment.

It automatically scans your `$pwd` for pom files and lists its name and version.

Along with [posh-git](https://github.com/dahlbyk/posh-git) it may look as follows:

    PS ~/projects/demo [de.clijsters.demo 1.0.0-SNAPSHOT]
    [master â‰¡ +0 ~2 -1 !]> 

## Project status

This project is in an early beta stadium. Wait... There is no code. Do you want to see some ascii art?

Well then look elsewhere
